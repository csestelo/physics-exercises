# physics-exercises

The purpose of the project is implement physics exercises for a better 
understanding of the theory.


## WIP

Implement a vector class which:

- [x] has a constructor based in magnitude + angle
- [x] has a constructor based in components
- [x] calculates the component in each direction
- [x] calculates the magnitude
- [ ] calculates the angle with the horizontal
- [ ] calculates the sum of two vectors
- [ ] calculates the multiplication with a scalar


## future

- add graphs visualization
- physics simulation framework
